# StartEdu - WebExtension

## Installation

The directory holding the manifest file can be added as an extension in developer mode in its current state.

Open the Extension Management page by navigating to:
```bash
chrome://extensions
```

The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
Click the **LOAD UNPACKED** button and select the extension directory.
Load Extension
Ta-da! 

The extension has been successfully installed. Because no icons were included in the manifest, a generic toolbar icon will be created for the extension.
